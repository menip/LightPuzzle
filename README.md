# LightPuzzle
A puzzle game with light as the theme.

# Background
This is my December 2017 learning project, done in Godot. I really enjoyed learning about the engine, and now plan to use it for future projects.

# About
Goal of the game is to reach star. You can select an initial direction, but then must depend on light bouncing it's way to the target. 

# Status
The project did not reach the level of completion I was hoping for, but I am releasing it now so that I can continue working on other projects. Hopefully others can find this useful, and perhaps let me know how I could have better approached the project.
